Purpose: 

to share 3rd party content at a single source.



Use Case:

User can view 3rd party links, and submit new links for additional content.



Mockup:

Urls are presented to the user in a list format.
A user can add new urls to content by clicking 'add new content'. This will present the user with an input field, which url can be pasted and submitted via a submit button.



proposed architecture style and technology stack:

v0.1: 
backend: nodejs and express
persistence: mongodb / postgres
front end: html, css, react / angular / vue. 



futher revisions: 

possible addition of comments section for each url to generate discussion.
( ? nested comments such as reddit). 
This would possible require some kind of user identity and at this juncture could be considered user authentication and authorisation features.
